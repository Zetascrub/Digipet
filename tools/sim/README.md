# Native render harness

Renders the Companion, Status, Settings, Genome Lab, and Battle screens
using the *real* production drawing code (`src/ui_pages.cpp`, extracted
verbatim from `main.cpp`) compiled for the host instead of the ESP32 -- no
board, no flash cycle. Useful for visually reviewing a UI change before
flashing, or for generating reference images to compare across changes.

## Use

```bash
tools/sim/render.sh companion /tmp/companion.png     # stage defaults to 2
tools/sim/render.sh status /tmp/status.png 4          # stage 4 = Titan
tools/sim/render.sh egg /tmp/egg.png                  # always stage 0
tools/sim/render.sh settings /tmp/settings.png        # home grid, page 1/2
tools/sim/render.sh settings2 /tmp/settings2.png      # home grid, page 2/2
tools/sim/render.sh settings-brightness /tmp/b.png    # any settingsView sub-view:
tools/sim/render.sh settings-idle /tmp/i.png          #   brightness|idle|volume|
tools/sim/render.sh settings-volume /tmp/v.png        #   wake|theme|boot
tools/sim/render.sh settings-wake /tmp/w.png
tools/sim/render.sh settings-theme /tmp/t.png
tools/sim/render.sh settings-boot /tmp/o.png
tools/sim/render.sh genomelab /tmp/genomelab.png
tools/sim/render.sh battle-fight /tmp/fight.png                 # mid-battle;
tools/sim/render.sh battle-fight-highstats /tmp/f2.png          #  also -lowhp|
tools/sim/render.sh battle-result /tmp/result.png                #  -submitted|
tools/sim/render.sh battle-result-copied /tmp/result2.png        #  -fleearmed|
tools/sim/render.sh battle-picker3 /tmp/picker.png                #  -nogenome
tools/sim/render.sh battle-picker7 /tmp/picker7-p2.png 1   # [stage] arg = results page
tools/sim/render.sh rivals /tmp/rivals.png 3          # [stage] arg = rival count (max 8)
tools/sim/render.sh rivals-empty /tmp/rivals-empty.png
tools/sim/render.sh status-actions /tmp/actions.png   # Status page's FEED/PLAY/TRAIN/RECON grid
tools/sim/render.sh recon /tmp/recon.png 5            # [stage] arg = signal count (max 8)
tools/sim/render.sh recon-empty /tmp/recon-empty.png
tools/sim/render.sh friends /tmp/friends.png 5        # [stage] arg = friend count (max 8)
tools/sim/render.sh friends-empty /tmp/friends-empty.png

# Any of the above also takes a 4th [theme] arg -- cyber-mint|amber-core|
# violet-link|mono-signal, or a kThemes[] index 1-4 (see include/ui_pages.h)
# -- to re-point every COLOR_* global the same way Settings > Theme does,
# without touching the file's own Cyber Mint-seeded globals. Omit it for
# that default. See ../../docs/style-guide.md for why checking a UI change
# against all 4 fixed themes, not just this default one, matters.
tools/sim/render.sh battle-fight /tmp/fight_amber.png 2 amber-core
```

Output is a real PNG at the panel's native 368x448, pixel-accurate RGB565
(same 16-bit color the panel actually gets sent -- not the AMOLED's own
color reproduction, which this can't capture).

## What this does and doesn't prove

**Proves:** layout, procedural creature/egg rendering across stage and
genome, color/theme values, text placement -- anything that's a pure
function of `pet`/theme-color state. If a change moves something off
Compositions screen or breaks a creature's silhouette, this will show it
immediately without a flash cycle.

**Doesn't prove:** touch feel, real elapsed-time animation, BLE battles
between two peers, or how the AMOLED itself reproduces these colors. Those
still need the physical board (see the root README's flashing instructions)
or, for protocol-only testing, `share/vpet-battle/vpet_battle_simulator.py`.

## How it works

`Arduino_Canvas` (the library's in-memory framebuffer class the real
firmware already renders every page into before blitting to the panel) has
no hardware dependency of its own -- it's pure pixel-array arithmetic. The
only thing standing between that and a native build was the rest of the
Arduino core (`String`, `Print`, `PROGMEM`, `millis()`) that
`Arduino_GFX`/the drawing code expect to exist. `tools/sim/fakes/` supplies
minimal stand-ins for exactly that surface (see each file's own comment) --
not a general Arduino compatibility layer, just enough for this.

`render_harness.cpp` defines the same global variables `include/ui_pages.h`
declares `extern` (colors, `pet`, sensor-detected flags, etc.) with fixed
test values, then calls the real page functions directly and dumps the
resulting canvas to a PPM (converted to PNG by `render.sh` via Pillow).

## Extending to more pages

Currently covers Companion (all 5 stages and all 5 body types' procedural
creature rendering), Status, the egg-stage Companion screen (all 10 egg
lineages), Settings (both home grid pages and all 6 settingsView
sub-views), Genome Lab, and Battle's Battling/Result/opponent-picker
states (drawBattlingLayout/drawBattleResultsPage/drawOpponentRow/
drawBattleButton -- already parameter-driven rather than reading the live
`battle` object, the same design that already let main.cpp's own
DUMPBATTLE/DUMPSCAN debug commands preview them, so no
`FamiliarBattleService` stand-in was actually needed). Battle's Idle/
Scanning/Hosting/Connecting states (drawBattlePage() itself, which *does*
read `battle` directly) and the boot sequence aren't extracted yet -- the
former needs a renderable `FamiliarBattleService` stand-in, the latter is
inherently animated-over-time rather than one static frame. To extend:

1. Identify the page function's dependencies the same way this pass did:
   `grep` the function body for globals it reads that aren't already
   declared in `include/ui_pages.h`.
2. Move the function (and any drawing-only helpers it calls that aren't
   already moved) from `src/main.cpp` into `src/ui_pages.cpp`, verbatim --
   no logic changes.
3. Add `extern` declarations for any newly-needed state to
   `include/ui_pages.h`, and function prototypes for anything moved.
4. `pio run -e waveshare_amoled_v2` to confirm the firmware still builds
   (should be a near-zero size delta -- code moved, not changed).
5. Define harness-side fakes for the new state in `render_harness.cpp`
   (or a fake object matching the real type's public interface, the way a
   `FamiliarBattleService` stand-in would need to for Battle).
